# The Story of Beginning

One morning in 1972, Dr. Bo Zhiyun was treating a patient suffering from intense low back pain with sciatica that resisted improvement.


A sudden inspiration reminded him that Governing Channel(Du Meridian) and Conception Channel (Ren Meridian)are paired in an exterior-internal relationship, and this moved him to try DU4, DU6 (on abdomen). Within 5 minutes, the patient’s pain disappeared. And what surprised him most was that the pain never returned after only this one treatment.


He repeated these points combination on several patients with similar conditions, and was surprised to find the same results every time.

Thus, Dr. Bo begun a 30-year exploration of the points of the abdomen that led to discovery of  the Prenatal or Congenital Channel System  that radiates from umbilicus. Sometimes, we call it Miraculous Tortoise because it's shape look like a short-leg tortoise. He become famous because of it.
