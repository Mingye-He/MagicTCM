Dietary Therapy

Dietary therapy is an essential aspect of Chinese medicine. Even before the development of acupuncture and herb, Chinese people found out the correlation between what you eat and health.

We like whole food with its own taste which build its function. We like seasonal food because they absorb the essence from the heaven and earth. And we think anti-seasonal food are poisonous and may hurt your body.

The first dish is mainly made of chilli beans and pearl barley beans, it's for draining dampness form our body to keep fit. And we know that it is very tasty and nutritive.
