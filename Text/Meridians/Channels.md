​We can say that the meridian theory is the core of TCM.

We classify the herbs by it's entering meridian. Nothing is too strange, there was a TCM doctor with special power, he could see through our body to watch the dynamic condition of the herb people took, and thus he created a special and effective herb formula therapy, called Small Small Formula.

# Lung Meridian of Hand Tai Yin
The Lung Meridians of Hand Taiyin originates from the middle energizer, running downward to connect with the large intestine(1). Wind back, it goes along the upper orifice of the stomach (2),passes through the diaphragm(3), and enters the lung, its pertaining organ(4). From the lung system, which refers to the portion of the lung communicating with the throat, it comes out transversely (Zhongfu, LU)(5).Desending along the medial aspect of the upper arm, it passes in front of the Heart Meridian of Hand-Shaoyin and the pericardium Meridian of Hand-Jueyin(6), and reaches the cubital fossa (7). Then it goes continuously downward along the anterior border of the radial side in the medial aspect of forearm(8) and enters cunkou (the radial artery at the wrist for pulse palpitation)(9).Passing the thenar eminence (10), it goes along its radial border (11),ending at the medial side of the tip of the thumb (Shaoshang, Lu11)(12).

The branch proximal to the wrist emerges from Lieque (LU7)(13), and runs directly to the radial side of the tip of the index finger (Shangyang, Lu1) where it links with the Large Intestine Meridians of Hand-Yangming.

The branch from the lower orfice of the stomach (18) descends inside the abdomen and joins the previous portion of the merdian at Qichong (ST 30). Running downward, transversing Biguan (ST31)(19), and further through Femur-Futu (ST32) (20), it reaches the Knee (21). From there, it continues downward ndalong the anterior border of the lateral aspect of the tibia (22),passes through the dorsum of the foot (23), and reaches the lateral side of the tip of the 2nd toe (Lidui, ST45) (24).

The tibia branch  emerges from Zu-sanli (ST36), 3 cun below the knee (25), and enters the lateral side of the middle toe (26).

The branch from the dorsum of the foot arises from the Chongyang (ST42) (27) and terminates at the medial side of the tip of the great toe (Yingbai, SP 1), where it links with the spleen Meridian of Foot-Taiyin.
