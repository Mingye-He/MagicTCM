Over many years, I  have been trained in many traditional and modern styles of acupuncture, such as Abdominal Acupuncture, Master Tung's Magic Points, Scalp Acupuncture, Ear Acupuncture, Jin 3 needle technique, Origin Points Therapy, Fire Acupuncture, etc.. 

My clinic practice has always been  the combination  of  all acupuncture technics to achieve the greatest and optimal benefit for my  patients. People say that I have magic hands. That makes me feel very happy.

Do you agree that good health is from a good life style that follow the laws of  nature? Otherwise, we would be punished with  suffering from diseases sooner or later. God made four seasons for a reasons. For example, summer is hot, but that's time for our body to drain dampness (by sweating) in order to drain toxins or junk from our body in order to get ready for the wonderful food coming in Autumn. What will happen if we don't sweat during Summer? --Overweight, Hypertension, Fatty liver, High cholesterol, Cardiovascular diseases...…, Etc..

Definitely, good health is not from one or two treatments neither. Your life style does a lot more influence than the treatments. Please think about that - what leads your conditions to here? Of course, it's a result from abusive behaviors of years. Please feel free to ask me during the treatment, I will be happy to help you figure that out and give you a free life-style consultation, which will be the most important thing in your health for the rest of your life.


We have an old saying，"病从口入，祸从口出"--the meaning is all the diseases come in by our mouth, all your calamity  come out from our mouth. So, please watch what and how you eat and how you talk.

 

Yellow Emperor Internal Classic, is the most important medical book of TCM and was written above 2000 years ago. It taught our Chinese how to take care of our bodies by meridians, by seasons and etc.. Its theories and methods has been tested by generations of us.

​

In clinic, I focus on the practice of  the Abdominal Acupuncture and Classic  Acupuncture because they are  very safe and effective.  Abdominal acupuncture is painless, safe, effective  and very relaxing method for all kind of chronic and stubborn diseases.

​

Also, I am very good at making a multiple treatment for my patient. I succeeded in treating the following disorders:

1. Pain, all kind of muscle, joint, tendon and nerve pain. Acupuncture is really a wonderful and natural pain-killer.

2. Gynecology Diseases, like UTI, Painful Menstruation, Amenorrhea, Cystitis, PMS, and etc.

3. Neurological disorder, like Parkinson's diseases, Sciatica, Shingle pain,  post-stroke hemi-paralysis, ADHD  and etc..

4. Other diseases, like urination disorders, common cold, mouth ulcer, hair loss, allergic nose and etc.
