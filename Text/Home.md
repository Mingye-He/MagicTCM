## What is acupuncture?

Acupuncture has been one of the therapeutic methods of TCM since New Stone Age about 4000-8000 years ago. It is considered one of the oldest forms of medicine. But right now, it is a very popular medical practice all over the world. Acupuncture started being popularized in the States during the early 70’s after President Nixon opened relations with China.

TCM sees the human body as an organic whole, a complete system made up of physical structures, emotions, mind, and spirit. That is why a lot of people feel relaxing and calm during & after acupuncture session. The clam and relaxing is a sign of homeostasis.

Acupuncture adjusts Yin-Yang balance of our body by the insertion of very fine, sterile disposable needles into specific points on the body. It has been used to prevent, diagnose and treat diseases, as well as to improve general health and maintain homeostasis of our body.
